<h1> Spotify-Playlist</h1>
The idea for this project was the poor matching of songs on Spotify.
<h2>Project Description</h2>
The project involves connecting to the Spotify api and authenticating the user so that the program can perform actions on the Spotify application to upload the generated playlist to it.

Open app.py and wait for the browser page to open <br>
